# basic-task-manager
The aim of this project was to practice javascript. The app does not work as intented as it will only render the input once, although it does create a new input field everytime the user adds a task. This functionality is not what i wanted to happen.
This project needs more work and is not finished. I would like to fix any bugs and add a little css to make it more user friendly.
I learn alot from this project on using Js to change the Dom and how to create and render elements using js.
